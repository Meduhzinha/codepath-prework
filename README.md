## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I followed the instructions that were on the prework page.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I had was that the index.HTML wasn't linked to the scrip.JS. So when I clicked on the start button it wasn't being added to the hidden class list. So I had to go back and revise what I was doing in order to fix it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I'm curious about how more complex web things are developed. Before this prework I had never used JS, HTML and CSS and because of it now I want to be more familiar with it.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would try to make the game more fun. Maybe adding different levels where as you go higher, new buttons would appear with new patterns and the speed would increase. It would also be nice to have a difficulty feature where the user would be able to choose if they want to play it easy, medium, hard or expert.
